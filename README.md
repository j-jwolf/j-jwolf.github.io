# Website Information version 0.0.1 5/12/2021
This is the code for my portfolio website. It's still under development but will eventually contain links to my GitHub projects that I believe are portfolio worthy, as well as smaller scale projects I created while learning and practicing various languages

## Notes
There is almost no content in the website at the moment
